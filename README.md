# Online_Examination_Management_System
This was my minor project during B.Tech days. The above uses php to create a website to do stuff related to examination.

- Copy all the files to a folder "myProject"
- Copy the folder to "C:\xampp\htdocs" if you're using Xampp server
- Open up Xampp control panel and hit start on Apache and MySQL
- Go to "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/" on your browser and import the database file provided.
- Open your browser and paste this on url "http://localhost/miniproject/home_page.php"
- Your program should be working fine!
